This week I used AI to help me navigate using Github again. I was having a really hard time getting a txt file and uploading it with a URL. I wasn't sure how to download it as I kept getting a read me file. I asked chatgpt if it could give me a rundown on how to use it. After getting instructions I was able to get a txt file. https://chatgpt.com/share/68d19082-7324-8009-8e43-96824c65028f

I also used AI to help with an assignment I had. One of my professors asked us to discuss our information literacy skills. I asked chatgpt to give me a clear understanding of what it meant so i could complete the assignment. https://chatgpt.com/share/68d19082-7324-8009-8e43-96824c65028f
